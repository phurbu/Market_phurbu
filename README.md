  Group Project by /cc Kelly, Phurbu and Daniel
  
#### Community based selling/trading marketplace.
    
   This is an app that will allow users that belong in the same community, to sell, buy and trade item amongst each other. Buyers who do no have money can still purchase their desired items by making trades based off items they are putting out on their the marketplace.
 
#### App function
		
 * People can only trade within their community. (School, work..etc) 
 * Items on the marketplace range from technology items, to beauty item (like nail polish)
 * This platform allows users to either trade items or make purchases with money
 * We will provide a range for suggested retail price (average price from different sources, like Ebay, Amazon and walmart) so that the price  for the product on the app will always be lower in comparison. 

#### Target
		
 * Anyone who is part of a trusted/validated community.  School, Workâ€¦.etc
